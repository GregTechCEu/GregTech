        "The §3Large Gas Turbine§r may not be so impressive in the §5EV§r Age, but it has the ability to scale really well, to §9better production§r than the base 4096 EU/t, and §9greater efficiency§r.\n\nEach Large Turbine will require a §aTurbine Rotor§r and a §3Rotor Holder§r. More on the Turbine mechanics in the §lnext§r Quest.\n\n§9Note:§r To harness the Power output when using a Rotor having more than 100% Power stats, you will need a §34A EV Dynamo Hatch§r or an §3IV Dynamo Hatch§r.\nTurbines §cvoid§r energy that they can not output."
