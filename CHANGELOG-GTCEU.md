            - Restrictive Pipes can be used to drastically increase priority value (lower priority)
        - Round Robin
            - Items will be evenly distributed to each destination
            - Unlike EnderIO, a single "group" of items extracted will be split across destinations
            - If an uneven amount of items to destinations, priority will break the tie

        - In total, Bronze/Steel/LV machines all have equivalent Steam Consumption (if using Steam Turbine for LV)
        - Many early game recipes tweaked to make the Bronze Machine nerf not as bad
        - Steel Steam Machine recipes are much more reasonable, requiring at most 1 Steel per machine, and being "direct upgrade" recipes for Bronze Machines

        - Added Steel Solar Boiler
        - Boilers have a more clear steam production, now per second instead of 25/10 ticks
        - Lava generators buffed by 3x
        - Bronze Solar Steam Boiler buffed by 2x
- Many JEI pages reworked (distillation tower, coke oven, assembly line) to be fancier
- Cable Loss reworked:
    - Lossless wires will now no longer damage you
    - Cables will always have lossy wires, unless they are "Superconductors"
    - Superconductors are available at every tier, and are available only wires to reduce clutter (also are different from 5u, should be more reasonable to make)

    - Can create Obsidian from Redstone
- Chanced output items now display their chance as a hovered text in JEI
- Added Emissive Textures
    - Can be disabled with a config (but why would you want to?)
    - Most machines "emit light" when active, and some when inactive
    - The light "emitted" is not real light, but instead a glow that can be seen in complete darkness, so no lighting updates caused

### Performance Improvements
- GT Machines will now cause no lag when idling, full inventory or not. Detailed info:
    - Previously GT machines would scan their item/fluid inventories each tick to attempt to run. Now they will only try to run when the inventory actually changes
    - Rough performance test by Spark, using 20 Multi-Smelters with a full input bus and full output buses:
        - OLD: ~4% TPS used
        - NEW: 0% TPS used
- Recipe lookup times were drastically improved. Detailed info:
    - Previously, recipe lookup was done by iterating over a List until a match was found. Now it does it by hashed keys based on inputs
    - Rough performance test by Spark, using 128 UV Macerators macerating Cobblestone:
        - OLD: ~22.5% TPS used
        - NEW: ~2.7% TPS used

### Misc Changes
- Many Material colors and IconSets (their overall appearance) have been updated

- Shaped and Shapeless Recipe methods in `ModHandler` can now accept more types
- `debug` config will now log failed recipe removals and additions
- There is now a "PrimitiveMultiblockController" base class, which uses a normal RecipeMap. When paired with the `PrimitiveRecipeBuilder`, it will:
    - Allow recipes to be run without power
    - (by default) Initialize inventory for items and fluids to the Controller instead of Multiblock Parts (overridable)
    - Hide the EU/t and Total EU info from the JEI page
- Recipe removal methods for Vanilla will now log failures if `ConfigHolder.debug` is enabled
- Recipe removal methods for GT added, located in `GTRecipeHandler`
- `MetaTileEntityMultiFurnace` was renamed to `MetaTileEntityMultiSmelter`
