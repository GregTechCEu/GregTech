    - Outputs up to 3B/s of water, or as low as 150mB depending on the Hatch used and the Biome it is placed in
    - Look at JEI Info Tab for more details
- Steam Machines now have a more distinct texture on their Venting Output
- Drums and Tanks can now be cleared via a crafting recipe (like EIO Tanks), similar to Quantum/Super Tanks
- Some Steam-Era Multiblock Machines were added:
    - Steam Grinder:
        - Multiblock Macerator at Steam-Age
        - Consumes 2x the base rate of Steam, at 1.5x the base duration, but up to 8 items at a time
    - Steam Oven:
        - Multiblock Furnace at Steam-Age

- Item Pipes have been added
    - Much larger throughput compared to options from other Mods
    - More efficient (TPS) than EnderIO Conduits
    - Two Modes with a Conveyor or Robot Arm cover:
        - Priority:
            - Each Pipe has a "priority" value
            - Items will go to the lowest priority value first
            - Restrictive Pipes can be used to drastically increase priority value (lower priority)
        - Round Robin
            - Items will be evenly distributed to each destination
            - Unlike EnderIO, a single "group" of items extracted will be split across destinations
            - If an uneven amount of items to destinations, priority will break the tie

        - In total, Bronze/Steel/LV machines all have equivalent Steam Consumption (if using Steam Turbine for LV)
        - Many early game recipes tweaked to make the Bronze Machine nerf not as bad
        - Steel Steam Machine recipes are much more reasonable, requiring at most 1 Steel per machine, and being "direct upgrade" recipes for Bronze Machines
    - Steam Boilers:
        - Added Steel Solar Boiler
        - Boilers have a more clear steam production, now per second instead of 25/10 ticks
        - Lava generators buffed by 3x
        - Bronze Solar Steam Boiler buffed by 2x

    - Is much faster than an Ore Washer, but grants no byproducts
    - Can do: crushed -> crushedPurified, impureDust -> dust, pureDust -> dust
    - Effectively an Electric Cauldron
- Fluid Pipe Algorithm fully reworked:
    - Pipes will behave similar to GT5, but without sloshing
    - Fluids will be evenly split across all directions at a pipe "junction"
    - Can also be set to Round Robin (with Pump cover)
- Added Quadruple (4) and Nonuple (9) Pipes, which can move multiple fluid types through them at once
- Distillation Tower Fluid Input Hatch can be placed on any block on the bottom layer. Energy Input Hatch can be placed on any block in the structure

### Major Recipe Changes
- Many, many new recipes for Vanilla items and blocks, with various configs to toggle
- Casings now only make 2 per craft (instead of 3), Frames are cheaper to craft
- Polybenzimidazole (PBI) has been added as a late-game polymer

- Uraninite processing is now slightly more complex (2 recipes total)
- Electrolysis recipes are now on average 4x less duration
- Ores that can be "directly smelted" into their materials have been reworked, so that dusts, crushed ore, etc will also direct smelt to the material
- Decomposition Recipes (electrolysis, centrifuging) will now divide down to as few inputs as possible, still retaining full dusts and full buckets of outputs
- Double Plates and Rounds were added, used in specific recipes
- Many, many, many progression-related recipes were fixed (mostly from SoG) to allow full progression in the base mod
- EBF coils now have slightly more complex recipes (configurable, default true)
- Coal Gas and Coal Tar were added as another optional but very beneficial source of resources
- Singleblock Distilleries will now always output the Item in the Distillation Recipe
- Alloys can no longer be handcrafted past Stainless Steel, and require an on-tier Mixer to make
- Harder recipes for Energy Hatches (configurable, default false)
- Config to disable in-world Concrete Powder -> Concrete conversion
- Indium now outputs 1 Small Dust each recipe instead of 1 Tiny Dust
- High Octane Gasoline (HOG) and Nitrobenzene were added as more power options (as well as normal Gasoline)

### Bug Fixes

- Many textures were fixed to be more consistent (z-fighting, improper coloration, etc.)
- Drums and Tanks now respect sneaking and will not fill a bucket when sneaking
- Steam Machines are no longer the Icon in JEI for machine categories
- All tiers of wood pipes can now be crafted by hand
- Fix Transformers not updating textures, and not properly sending a chat message
- Machines with lots of slots causing the "Title" to overlap now have a larger GUI (no overlap)
- Fix rare world corruption bug with Redstone cache
- Fix Rubber Trees spawning in a perfect grid pattern
- Drums now properly display their Tank contents in TheOneProbe

    - Sorted in groups of voltage-tier, with duration increasing within each tier
- Fix recipes in JEI taking an odd number of ticks rounding up
    - 1 tick recipes properly display as 0.05s (instead of 0.1s)
    - Example: 19 ticks will show as 0.95s (before would have been 1s)
- Cables and Wires now properly respect amperage on the line
- Machines (and other Energy-acceptors) now no longer accept their maximum amount of amps per side, instead its per container
- Cables will no longer burn improper parts of the network, and now is only the overamped/overvolted portion

### CraftTweaker
- Materials can now automatically generate IDs
    - Be careful, as changing the order of this will cause items in-world to disappear
- Coke Oven and PBF have normal RecipeMaps now, instead of using custom ones

- Electrolyzer and Centrifuge now show all 12 slots at once

### Internal Changes
- UHV - UXV Tiers are supported natively by GTCEu for addons to take advantage of
- `Elements` is no longer an Enum
- Machines can now be indestructable and Wither Proof, if properly set in the Class

    - TODO
- OrePrefix is no longer an Enum, and can easily be added to by addons
- Shaped and Shapeless Recipe methods in `ModHandler` can now accept more types
- `debug` config will now log failed recipe removals and additions
- There is now a "PrimitiveMultiblockController" base class, which uses a normal RecipeMap. When paired with the `PrimitiveRecipeBuilder`, it will:
    - Allow recipes to be run without power
    - (by default) Initialize inventory for items and fluids to the Controller instead of Multiblock Parts (overridable)
    - Hide the EU/t and Total EU info from the JEI page
