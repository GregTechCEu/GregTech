# GregTech Community Edition 

This is a fork of GregTech Community Edition for MC 1.12.2 maintained by the Gregicality development team. No work has been done on it at the moment.

## Welcome to GregTech Community Edition
### What is this?
GregTech Community Edition, or **GTCE**, is a Minecraft mod. The repository contains all the code and assets required to build and run that mod.

### GregTech?
Yes, you have probably heard this name before as it is quite known in the Minecraft modding community. GTCE is an **indirect descendant** and **total rewrite** of _**GregTech**_.  It is **neither created nor maintained by GregoriusT** but was created with his knowledge and permission.

This mod is about **technology** and **progression**.
* From simple crude tools which will allow you to process resources more realistically...
* Through **Steam Age** where early machines will help you save some precious resources and open new possibilities...
* To many **Electric Ages** where increasingly complex machines and logistics will become indispensable parts of your industrial regime.

A typical GregTech facility features large arrays of both single- and multi-block machines processing numerous resources, creating even more complex materials which will be used in machines of higher tiers.

All of which are powered by GTCE's own power systems, featuring generators from simple wood burning for steam to plasma-powered turbines.

### Community Edition?
**Community Edition** is a necessary part of the **GTCE name**: 
* It is required by our permission to use the GregTech name
* It is a reminder that the ideas and design are primarily driven by the community
* It is a reminder that the implementation and work are solely provided by the community.

Of course, this does not mean that everyone can add whatever content they want.  But it does mean that the primary maintainers want to listen to the community and take suggestions and ideas to heart when planning or working on any projects.

### Project Goal
To bring preferred GregTech concepts and ideas from GT (Minecraft 1.7.10 versions and earlier) to Minecraft 1.12, targetting a feature-rich, UX-friendly and comprehensive play-through while streamlining and eliminating bloat and make-work details.

Gregtech 5 Unofficial was used as an original base, with some ideas from GT4 and GT6 also incorporated. Many community suggestions have been since applied.

We work with our addon-partners to attempt to preserve backwards-compatibility.

### Release cycle
GTCE follows a two week release cycle (when possible). 
Changelogs are generated and beautified after merging PRs every other Monday. Changelog is then submitted as a Pull Request (PR).
Releases are built and deployed on Tuesdays after merging the Changelog PR.

## Contribution
### Current state of project
GTCE is under active development with regular updates. It is primarily maintained by a "GTCE Council" of contributors of various talent: developers, designers and modpack authors. This council is coordinated by @LAGIdiot. The GTCE community is very active and regularly contributes code, testing and ideas.
We are always looking for contributors!
